      <description>Check out the previous post.&#xA;work done until now code on github&#xA;The original list(s):&#xA;nice-ish working front to be able to upload/download files actual background removal mechanix, but since it&amp;rsquo;s python this should be doable host it somewhere in my infra for it to be usable Nice to have-s:&#xA;instead of uploading an image pass a URL self-managed-file-deleting back-end option to select which model is used for the bgRemoval publically available on github to finally give back to community!</description>

      <description>code on github&#xA;This week I learned about a new app for Androids: phyPhox. It was shown to me by a friend from work. It was in a context of measuring the speed of elevators in buildings&amp;hellip; First things first - it allows to measure and log values from phones sensors - pressure, accelerometer, gyro, magnetometers, GPS, sound (amplitude, frequency). It&amp;rsquo;s a quite well written app. So, I have a super slow elevator in my building, where I live.</description>

      <description>There is a bucket in my life. Not a bucket list, not a real bucket.&#xA;A metaphor of a bucket.&#xA;A place from which I feel like I draw my power. To do things, to be productive, &amp;ldquo;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;There&amp;#39;s a secret place I like to go -Megadeth, Month before my birthday It&amp;rsquo;s a space, in which I find the willpower to run my life and do fun, impressive, good stuff.</description>

      <description>On the weekend of 21-23.08.2025 I went to my home, where I took some photos with my new camera.&#xA;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say these are the best photos in the world, and I still have to learn a lot.. Yet still, I&amp;rsquo;m happy with them!</description>

      <description>So uh, I kind of like to use background removers like remove.bg.. However there is an issue with them&amp;hellip;&#xA;They offer limited resolution of the output image and try charging like ~1$ per full image resolution inference&amp;hellip;&#xA;That seems un-cheap and I have the knowledge (insert Tai Lopez meme here) to build something like that for myself from ~scratch.&#xA;I recently adore NiceGUI for my projects and since this seems like a perfect use case I decided to go for it.</description>

      <description>Creating this blog is kind of a fun part for me. Partly I hate it, but partly it&amp;rsquo;s a ready-made solution which requires proper configuration and a reasonable time spent to make it work. It&amp;rsquo;s mildly infuriating until you actually try to deploy it in a reasonable place like github pages. At that point it becomes simply unbearable.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s exactly like this, but I&amp;rsquo;m 3780 % more pissed than I should be ðŸ˜…&amp;hellip;</description>
