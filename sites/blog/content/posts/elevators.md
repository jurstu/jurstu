This week I learned about a new app for Androids: [phyPhox](https://phyphox.org/). It was shown to me by a **friend from work**. It was in a context of measuring the speed of elevators in buildings... 
First things first - it allows to measure and log values from phones sensors - pressure, accelerometer, gyro, magnetometers, GPS, sound (amplitude, frequency). It's a quite well written app. 
So, I have a super slow elevator in my building, where I live. And I've been shown that there is a super slow elevator at my friends flat. I was like: "hey, my elevator could compete in this contest" to which they were like: "Your's is surely faster.." and I was like: **"a contest.. in which the slowest elevator wins"**. 
When I came home I actually measured the pressure to get the difference in heights over time. I got a climbing rate of around 0.6 m/s.

My elevator be like:
