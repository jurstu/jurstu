[code on github](https://github.com/jurstu/BackgroundBlaster)

The original list(s):

- [X] nice-ish working front to be able to upload/download files
- [X] actual background removal mechanix, but since it's python this should be doable
- [ ] host it somewhere in my infra for it to be usable

Nice to have-s:

- [ ] instead of uploading an image pass a URL 
- [X] self-managed-file-deleting back-end
- [ ] option to select which model is used for the bgRemoval
- [X] publically available on github to finally give back to community!
