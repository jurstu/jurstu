<h1 id="so-ryanair">So, Ryanair</h1>
<p>We had a planned flight at 20:40 of local time. A plane <a href="https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/krakow/dramatyczna-relacja-z-incydentu-na-lotnisku-w-krakowie-linie-wydaly-komunikat/m6pb9zy#:~:text=Gro%C5%BAny%20incydent%20na%20lotnisku%20w%20Krakowie.&amp;text=Samolot%20linii%20Enter%20Air%20podczas,pok%C5%82adzie%20by%C5%82o%20ok.%20190%20os%C3%B3b.">landing in Cracow skidded(?) of the runway and fell into the green parts of the airport</a> around 15:20 that day.</p>
<p>Because of that there were massive crowds at the airport and none of the scheduled flights were taking off. Neither was ours. But we didn&rsquo;t know that yet ðŸ™ƒ. Between our arrival at around 17:05 and us leaving the airport a few things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Security was scheduled to be closed until 19. (around 17:40)</li>
<li>Ryan gave no info (It was kinda obvious we weren&rsquo;t going to fly this day, but no info means you have to stay at the airport)</li>
<li>Security was scheduled to be closed until 20. (around 18:40)</li>
<li>We preemptively booked a hotel in Cracow</li>
<li>Ryan gave no info</li>
<li>Got a glimpse of possible outcome by watching people get transfered (also by Ryan) to Katowice Airport by bus (~1h drive)</li>
<li>Security was scheduled to be closed until 21. (around 19:40)</li>
<li>Started to look for food, since already starving</li>
<li>While in the queue for food (with another 30-ish people) Security got scheduled to open at 22:00, Ryanair rescheduled the flight to 12:00 next day (not midnight) and since it&rsquo;s a &gt;3h delay and no alternative was provided we decided to go to the hotel and sleep the night.</li>
<li>At 4:05 (nighttime) Ryan sends out sms to us &ldquo;We got You vouchers for these 4 places in Cracow Airport&rdquo; - 2 poor coffee shops and 2 bistros.</li>
<li>We arrived at the airport around 9:20, went to the places were we were supposed to be able to redeem our coupons&hellip; guess what - Ryanair didn&rsquo;t send anyone new tickets, for rebooked flight, with new flight number.. TO WHICH THE COUPONS WERE ATTATCHED ðŸ™ƒ</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; don&#39;t expect much
&gt; still get dissapointed
</code></pre><ol start="12">
<li><strike>WTF</strike> TFW, we didn&rsquo;t know about the new tickets at this point, neither did the cashier.. Fuckin Ryan</li>
<li>We got crepes at another place..</li>
<li>Robot delivered it.. Let&rsquo;s go I guess</li>
<li>We ate, got through security and went to the gate, with priority since we got extra cabin luggage (finally a win)</li>
<li>A flight attendant checks our tickets - they&rsquo;re invalid</li>
<li>Heart drop, wtf-moment, keep calm and let the person do their job by figuring out what&rsquo;s going on&hellip;</li>
<li>They let us through since they see we&rsquo;ve been booked on the original flight</li>
<li>Crazy day, crazy night</li>
<li>22:20 next day, still didn&rsquo;t get &ldquo;new&rdquo; tickets</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve landed and I&rsquo;m writing this from Greece. However we still haven&rsquo;t discussed the 15h 20m flight delay. For which I&rsquo;m expecting to get reimbursed for my expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>ubers/taxis from/to airport</li>
<li>place to sleep</li>
<li>food to eat while not in Greece</li>
</ul>
<p>And this looks all fine and dandy - all I have to do is (apply for compensation on Ryanair&rsquo;s site)[https://onlineform.ryanair.com/pl/pl/eu-261]. This however, <strong>already seems like a scam</strong>, especially since there is a long list of &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t apply for compensation if:&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m gonna try anyway, since this is a bitter drop in my chalice. I&rsquo;m going to try my best to recoup what was spent since Ryan didn&rsquo;t send us to Katowice (for which I&rsquo;m actually glad, but I&rsquo;ll explain in a minute) to make our flight. They could&rsquo;ve offered transport and flights from another airport yet still, they prefered to delay the flight by 15h 20m. Which actually was good for us since&hellip;</p>
<p>The flights from Katowice never departed and travelers were returned to Cracow (&gt;2h commute for nothing).</p>
<p>Please hate the scammer and hate the scam.</p>
<p>The End ðŸ™ƒ</p>
