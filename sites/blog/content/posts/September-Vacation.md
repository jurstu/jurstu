# So, Ryanair 

We had a planned flight at 20:40 of local time. A plane [landing in Cracow skidded(?) of the runway and fell into the green parts of the airport](https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/krakow/dramatyczna-relacja-z-incydentu-na-lotnisku-w-krakowie-linie-wydaly-komunikat/m6pb9zy#:~:text=Gro%C5%BAny%20incydent%20na%20lotnisku%20w%20Krakowie.&text=Samolot%20linii%20Enter%20Air%20podczas,pok%C5%82adzie%20by%C5%82o%20ok.%20190%20os%C3%B3b.) around 15:20 that day.

Because of that there were massive crowds at the airport and none of the scheduled flights were taking off. Neither was ours. But we didn't know that yet ðŸ™ƒ. Between our arrival at around 17:05 and us leaving the airport a few things happen:

1. Security was scheduled to be closed until 19. (around 17:40) 
2. Ryan gave no info (It was kinda obvious we weren't going to fly this day, but no info means you have to stay at the airport)
3. Security was scheduled to be closed until 20. (around 18:40)
4. We preemptively booked a hotel in Cracow
5. Ryan gave no info
6. Got a glimpse of possible outcome by watching people get transfered (also by Ryan) to Katowice Airport by bus (~1h drive)
7. Security was scheduled to be closed until 21. (around 19:40)
8. Started to look for food, since already starving
9. While in the queue for food (with another 30-ish people) Security got scheduled to open at 22:00, Ryanair rescheduled the flight to 12:00 next day (not midnight) and since it's a >3h delay and no alternative was provided we decided to go to the hotel and sleep the night. 
10. At 4:05 (nighttime) Ryan sends out sms to us "We got You vouchers for these 4 places in Cracow Airport" - 2 poor coffee shops and 2 bistros. 
11. We arrived at the airport around 9:20, went to the places were we were supposed to be able to redeem our coupons... guess what - Ryanair didn't send anyone new tickets, for rebooked flight, with new flight number.. TO WHICH THE COUPONS WERE ATTATCHED ðŸ™ƒ 
```
> don't expect much
> still get dissapointed
```
12. <strike>WTF</strike> TFW, we didn't know about the new tickets at this point, neither did the cashier.. Fuckin Ryan
13. We got crepes at another place..
14. Robot delivered it.. Let's go I guess
15. We ate, got through security and went to the gate, with priority since we got extra cabin luggage (finally a win)
16. A flight attendant checks our tickets - they're invalid
17. Heart drop, wtf-moment, keep calm and let the person do their job by figuring out what's going on...
18. They let us through since they see we've been booked on the original flight
19. Crazy day, crazy night
20. 22:20 next day, still didn't get "new" tickets


Now, we've landed and I'm writing this from Greece. However we still haven't discussed the 15h 20m flight delay. For which I'm expecting to get reimbursed for my expenses:
- ubers/taxis from/to airport
- place to sleep
- food to eat while not in Greece

And this looks all fine and dandy - all I have to do is (apply for compensation on Ryanair's site)[https://onlineform.ryanair.com/pl/pl/eu-261]. This however, **already seems like a scam**, especially since there is a long list of "You don't apply for compensation if:". I'm gonna try anyway, since this is a bitter drop in my chalice. I'm going to try my best to recoup what was spent since Ryan didn't send us to Katowice (for which I'm actually glad, but I'll explain in a minute) to make our flight. They could've offered transport and flights from another airport yet still, they prefered to delay the flight by 15h 20m. Which actually was good for us since...

The flights from Katowice never departed and travelers were returned to Cracow (>2h commute for nothing).

Please hate the scammer and hate the scam.

The End ðŸ™ƒ
