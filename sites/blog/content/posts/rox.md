There is a bucket in my life. Not a bucket list, not a real bucket. 

A **metaphor** of a bucket. 

A place from which I feel like I draw my power. To do things, to be productive, "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield".

```
There's a secret place I like to go
                            -Megadeth, Month before my birthday
```


It's a space, in which I find the willpower to run my life and do fun, impressive, good stuff. 

I'm not sure how big is it, and I have no real way to check... 

But I have to believe It's **filled by inspiration** and **emptied by doing good work**.  This actually ties well to the fact of my workaholism. Think about it... The fact that I have a model of a bucket, which powers my will and is filled by inspiring myself. Often with warrior-alike attitude. Iron Man, KungFu Panda.. others...

There is a quote for this, I found out I liked for quite some time now.. It's in Polish, though

```
I chociaż nie chce mi się strasznie to mi każe pisać
Fakt że dla was to jest skała lita dla nas plastelina
```

Loosely translated it means:

```
And even though I don’t want to, it pushes me through,
What is putty to me is a solid rock to you.
```
