This week I've been to NYC, and among seeing nice sights I've visited some skyscrappers. One of those was "Top of the Rock" which actually was the tallest skyscrapper in Rockerfeller center. It was nice, and here are the plots of the descent in the elevator (tried to capture the ascention but missed it unfortunatelly).

**-7m/s** Yikes, that's fast. Besides - look at that S curve ! It's almost like.. someone actually designed it that way : - )

Photos and stories from NYC coming later, probably next week.
